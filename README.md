# Craftory Lite - ALPHA

![Description](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cs66rvebp67vhmb/bannerBarDescription.png?raw=1)
Craftory sets out to extend and push the boundaries of vanilla Minecraft, offering features only thought possible before with Modded Minecraft. After installing the plugin, you players can join without having to install or do anything and experience all the amazing features Craftory has to offer.

Currently Craftory adds more technology to the game, with a fully-fledged Power System, Electric Furnaces, Ore Doubling, Generators, Power Cells and much more soon to come!! All of these have custom textures and functionality without overriding any Minecraft textures.

## Disclaimer
This Plugin is currently in ALPHA, we have many features that are currently almost functional, but don't want to release them quite yet till we feel they are ready for testing. As this is an ALPHA everything is subject to change, although we will try to ensure old data continues to work. 
We have future plans to turn some current items like generators into multi-block structures, add more interesting machines, build out a full tech tree with better progress and even future plans to add magic as a companion to tech.

![FAQ](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mbk5843racd4qot/bannerBarFAQ.png?raw=1)
These are some of the questions that are asked quite frequently. Please check to see if your question has already been answered here before seeking support.

**Why do I see mushroom blocks when I place items?**
This is to do with ItemsAdder most likely and probably means that the texture pack hasn't been setup correctly. Make sure you followed the install steps correctly. If it still doesn't work you can check ItemsAdder wiki for more indepth details or contact us.

**What versions does Craftory support?**
Craftory is still currently in ALPHA, this means that its features are chaning rapidly so we don't yet want to support anything but the native Minecraft version it was built for.
This means Minecraft 1.15.2, is the only offically supported version.

**Why does this required ItemsAdder, which is a Premium plugin?**
This plugin sets out to go beyond most existing plugins and bring new features that sit between mods and plugins. While trying to achieve this we are having to create a lot of more complex features, which take time to maintain on top of trying to expand the plugin.

Due to this we wanted to leave custom texturing to another plugin that has been developed for a long time and recieves frequent support, ensuring that not only is it stable, but is updated to reflect the ever changing features and code that make up Minecraft. While I have in the past writen my own version that did similar, there is no point trying to create something that has already been done at this time, especially when it would just take away from the development of other features.
