<h3>Dprecation Warning</h3>
<b>This version of Craftory is end of life, the state of the code has made progress slow, we are currently working on an updated version which will be shared open source when we can get it to an MVP stage. At that point we will divide the plugin into seperate smaller plugins to allow server owners more control and also allow other developers to build their own addons using the tools we are creating! For any questions check out our discord server.</b>

<h5>DEVELOPERS: Please feel free to still submit bug fixes and version updates to this repo, as we intend to support it with community help until the new version is stable</h5>

Craftory sets out to extend and push the boundaries of vanilla Minecraft, offering features only thought possible before with Modded Minecraft. After installing the plugin, your players can join without having to install or do anything and experience all the amazing features Craftory has to offer.

Currently, Craftory adds more technology to the game, with a fully-fledged Power System, Electric Furnaces, Ore Doubling, Generators, Power Cells and much more soon to come!! All of these have custom textures and functionality without overriding any Minecraft textures.

Usage
Details on how to use the plugin can be found on our Wiki.
We will also be releasing an in-game guidebook at a later date.

**Disclaimer**
This Plugin is currently in ALPHA, we have many features that are currently almost functional, but don't want to release them quite yet until we feel they are ready for testing. As this is an ALPHA everything is subject to change, although we will try to ensure old data continues to work.
We have future plans to turn some current items like generators into multi-block structures, add more interesting machines, build out a full tech tree with better progress and even future plans to add magic as a companion to tech.

WARNING: This makes use of Server Resource Pack! This is automatically set up, you must use it.
This current version isn't compatible with servers that use a custom resource pack. If you know-how, you can merge ours and your resource pack and it will work.
